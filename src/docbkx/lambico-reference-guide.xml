        <para>Lambico is a project aiming to simplify the persistence layer
        of your applications by providing a manner for easily defining
        the DAOs that manage the data stored in your database.
        </para>
        <para>With Lambico you can define the DAOs for your entities just writing
        their interfaces, with no implementation at all:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Dao(entity=Person.class)
public interface PersonDao extends GenericDao<Person, Long> {
}]]></programlisting>
        <para>You don't need to write anything else, your DAO will be instrumented
        at runtime with all the methods you can expect: read, create, delete,
        store, findAll, etc.
        </para>
        <para>If you need your specific query methods, you can simply add them
        to your interface. For example:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Dao(entity=Person.class)
public interface PersonDao extends GenericDao<Person, Long> {
  List<Person> findByFirstName(String firstName);
}]]></programlisting>
        <para>The findByFirstName method will be instrumented exactly as you expect,
        querying the Person entity for all instances having the firstName property
        equal to the passed parameter.
        </para>
        <para>Of course there are other mechanisms for adding to your DAOs exactly the
        queries you need for them
        </para>

            <para>The starting point for using Lambico is adding it to your
            development project. In the following sections we will examine how
            to add Lambico in a Maven based project.</para>
