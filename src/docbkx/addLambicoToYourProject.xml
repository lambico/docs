        <title>Adding Lambico to your project</title>
    </info>
    <para>The starting point for using Lambico is adding it to your
            development project. In the following sections we will examine how
            to add Lambico in your projects.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="choose-your-lambico">
        <info>
            <title>Choose your Lambico</title>
        </info>
        <para>Lambico is architected for being introduced in projects using
        different persistence, IoC and AOP frameworks. So the first thing you have
        to evaluate is if Lambico is supporting your current combination
        of frameworks, or if you are confortable to introduce in your project
        one of the supported combination.
        </para>
        <para>At present Lambico is supporting the following combinations:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Spring + Hibernate</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>More combinations are planned and will be supported
        in the future. For example, some combination we are planning are Spring + pure JPA,
        CDI + Hibernate and CDI + pure JPA.
        If you like to contribute to the development of Lambico for a
        combination you are interestend in, please go to the

        </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="add-lambico-using-maven">
        <info>
            <title>Using Maven</title>
        </info>
        <para>If you are using Maven for building your project, you simply need
        to add a dependency to your 
            <filename>pom.xml</filename>.
        </para>
        <para>At present Lambico is not distributed through a stable release. (but it will be soon)</para>
        <para>You can pick the latest development release adding the following repository
        to your 
            <filename>pom.xml</filename> or to your
            <filename>settings.xml</filename>.
            <programlisting><![CDATA[<repository>

    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
</repository>]]></programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            Then add the dependency needed for the Lambico combination you choosed:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Spring + Hibernate:

    <section xml:id="add-lambico-without-maven">

            <title>Without Maven</title>
        </info>
        <para>If you aren't using Maven for building your project, you'll have
        to add to the classpath of your application the Lambico's JARs, and the JARs of
        all the libraries Lambico depends from.</para>
        <para>First of all, choose the Lambico combination that best fits your needs, and download
        the "library" archive from the download area of the Lambico project site:

                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>Extract the JARs from the archive and add them to your project.</para>
